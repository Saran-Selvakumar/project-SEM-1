All she desires<br> is to heal the wounds that haunt her every move,<br> not allowing her to be herself. Neither can she forget Haasil nor<br> can she reach him any more. That is, until<br> she meets . . . Palki, Haasil's ex-wife who<br> is presumed dead by the world. Talking to Palki,<br> Pallavi realizes she has found the ultimate weapon<br> to destroy Haasil: the one man who changed her life<br> and persona forever. She plans a deadly set of events<br> that catch Haasil, Palki and his current love, Swadha,<br> unaware. As the dice of destiny is rolled, the question<br> looms: will Pallavi destroy Haasil irreversibly using his<br> once true love, Palki, or will she, for once, come to <br>terms with her deep love for him? A Thousand Kisses Deep is an <br>emotional whirlwind depicting modern layered relationships, lost<br> love and how, sometimes, destiny's plans are quite contrary <br>to what we have been coveting all our life. As Haasil, Pallavi,<br> Palki and Swadha go about life seeking their personal<br> answers and solace, they realize love, after all, is still <br>not done with any of them . . .</b></i><br><br>
