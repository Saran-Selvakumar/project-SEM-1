The movie she has in mind is a f/f rom-com because, as a bisexual girl, she never gets to see herself represented in movies other than as stereotypes. Meanwhile, Sophia, her nemesis, is back in town after living in Paris for the past year. She joins Emma and their friends on the crew although they disagree on everything.

                    I really liked Emma’s reasons for directing a gay rom-com. Although she is bisexual, it means a lot to her that people recognize that while she could “end up” with a guy, she could still date girls, especially because she hasn’t come out to her parents.
