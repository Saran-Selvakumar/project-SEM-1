One day, after a week of Sam's death, Julie decides to call Sam to try and hear his voice for one last time. And to her surprise, he actually picks up. For some reason, Julie and Sam have this special connection even after death, but both Sam and Julie are aware that their time together is running out, and the phone calls won't last forever.
        The plot of this story and its elements of fantasy intrigued me at first, but when I actually started reading, I was very underwhelmed. If I'm being honest, Julie as a character was very irritating. I understood that she was dealing with grief from losing a loved one, but when I read the flashback scenes, I slowly understood that Julie was always selfish and irritating from day 1. Adding onto an unlikeable main character were the "antagonists" of the novel. Liam and Taylor were some of Sam's childhood friends and we're told that they never really liked Julie in the first place. But after Sam's death, both of them blame Julie for what happened to Sam and are just overall cruel and unnecessarily racist to Julie's Asian friends. To be honest, Liam and Taylor were horribly written "villains."

<br>Along with my guide, a frog named Scribblehopper,<br> I set off on an incredible adventure to save the<br> Queen of the Fairies. But along the way, I had to face<br> giant scorpions, witches, sea serpents, pixies,<br> and dozens of other creatures that I had only<br> ever heard stories about. Holey cheese, what a <br>journey! Could I save the Queen...and my own tail?</b></i><br><br>
