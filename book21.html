Pegasus is a bar that is supposed to cater to a rich and elite clientele, it will be much western in its décor and dance styles.

        To give wings to his dream of such a bar, he carefully curates the experience by bringing together a highly qualified team of the best dancers (Sizzling Shabnam, Jyoti Jalwa), sturdy bouncers (Bulldozer and team), and also wins over the upright cop Suraj Wankhede who will support him in keeping the dirty business of drugs away from his establishment.
        
        But after spending great amounts of money and an equally considerable amount of time, trouble brews for Suleman Raja and his dream project in the form of Iqbal Safedi and Kareem CoCa. These two are hell-bent on infiltrating the establishment and using it for their dirty and illegal business of drugs.</b></i><br><br>
