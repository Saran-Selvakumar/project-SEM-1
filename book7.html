Not dislike. Not begrudgingly tolerate. H-A-T-E. Lucy can't understand Josh's joyless, uptight approach to his job and refusal to smile, which is in stark contrast to her bright clothes, quirkiness, and effusive people-pleasing. Trapped in a shared office 5 days a week, they've become entrenched in an addictive, ridiculous never-ending game of one-upmanship. Lucy can't let Josh beat her at anything - especially when a huge new promotion to be Managing Director is up for grabs. They strike a deal that whoever does not get the promotion must quit. It's game-on - But as tensions reach boiling point and an innocent elevator ride turns into a steamy kiss, Lucy begins to realize just how fine a line there is between love and hate.<br><b style="font-size: 20px;">PRICE : â‚¹338</b>
